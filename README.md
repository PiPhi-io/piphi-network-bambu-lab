# Piphi Network Bambu Lab

Generated PiPhi integration runtime.

## Run locally

```bash
pdm install -G dev
pdm run uvicorn piphi_network_bambu_lab.main:app --reload --port 4203
pdm run pytest
pdm run python scripts/validate.py
```

The runtime listens on port `4203` by default and exposes the common PiPhi runtime route contract:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /diagnostics`
- `POST /discover`
- `POST /config`
- `POST /config/sync`
- `POST /deconfigure`
- `POST /deconfigure/{config_id}`
- `GET /state`
- `GET /contract`
- `GET /entities`
- `GET /events`
- `POST /events/device/{config_id}/example`
- `POST /telemetry/example`
- `POST /telemetry/device/{config_id}/example`
- `POST /command`

## Capability coverage

`capability-catalog.json` inventories the reviewed upstream state, events,
conditions, and actions. Every entry is classified as implemented, planned, or
excluded with its source, scope, and rationale. Contract tests enforce that
only implemented entries appear in the manifest, entities, commands, and
behavior contract.

Model-specific capabilities remain planned until discovery, normalization,
dispatch, and executable tests exist. This keeps the scaffold honest while
preserving the complete implementation roadmap.

## Manifest

`manifest.json` is a starter manifest. Before publishing, update:

- `image`
- `version`
- capabilities and commands
- config fields and identity fields
- entity metadata

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t docker.io/piphinetwork/piphi-network-bambu-lab:0.1.0 .
docker run --rm -p 4203:4203 docker.io/piphinetwork/piphi-network-bambu-lab:0.1.0
```
